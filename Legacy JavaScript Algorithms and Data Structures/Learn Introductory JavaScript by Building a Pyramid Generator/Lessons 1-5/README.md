Step 1

    JavaScript is the programming language tjat powers the web. Unlike the HTML and CSS you have learned previously, JavaScript is most commonly used to write logic intead of markup. 

    In this project, you will lear the basics of JavaScript and apply those concepts to building a pyramid generator.

    A pyramid generator is a program where you can set the type of character, the count for the pyramid, and the direction of the pyramid. The program woll then genereate a pyramid based on those inputs.


Step 2

    Variables: this points to a specific memory address that stores value. Variables are given a name which can be used throughout your code to access that value. 

    Declaring a variable means giving it a name. In JavaScript, this is often donde with "let" keyword. For example, here is how you would declare a hello variable:
        
        let hello;
    
    Variable naming follows specific rules: names can include letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores, but cannot contain spaces and must not begin with a number.


Step 3

    You can assign a value using the assignment operator =. For example:
        let hello = "Hello";

    Assigning a value to a variable at the moment of its declaration is known as initialization.


Step 4

    JavaScript has seven primitive data types, with 
        String being one of them: this represents a sequence of characters and can be enclosed in either single (') or double (") quotes.

    Note that strings are immutable, which means once they are created, they cannot be changed. The variable can still be reassigned another value.


Step 5
    The console allows you to print and view JavaScript output. You can send information to the console using console.log(). For example, this code will print "Naomi" to the console:

    Example Code
        let developer = "Naomi";
        console.log(developer);

    The code above accesses the developer variable with its name in the console.log(). -Note that the value between the parentheses is the value that will be printed-.
    

Step 6

    When a variable is declared with the let keyword, you can reassign (or change the value of) that variable later on. In this example, the value of programmer is changed from "Naomi" to "CamperChan".

    Example Code
        let programmer = "Naomi";
        programmer = "CamperChan";
            
    Note that when reassigning a variable, you do not use the let keyword again.

    After your console.log, assign the value "World" to your character variable.
